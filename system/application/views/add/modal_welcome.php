Welcome <strong><?php echo $user ?></strong>,
<p> Thanks very much for making it this far in adding your Personal Trainer Profile to PT Wall.<br />We are seriously thrilled.</p>
<p>
	When you continue, you will be taken to Twitter to authorize us. The next step is to create your profile with us by providing a bit of your personal details and qualifications. Then you are published immediately. It's pretty easy.<br />
	If you do not have your Qualification details handy, do not worry, though you will need to <strong>return in 7 days</strong> and add them to your profile.</p>
<p> 
	We only list Qualified Personal Trainers with current accreditation with recognized registered fitness agencies. Cowboys are not welcome, sorry.<br />
Also if you find that your base qualification or Accredited Organization as a Personal Trainer is not listed, please contact straight away.
