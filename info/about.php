 <p>Certified Personal Trainers add themselves to create a <strong style="color:#666666;">free</strong> profile page adding their <strong style="color:#666666;">location</strong> and specialty <strong style="color:#666666;">tags</strong>.<br />
 Location detectors in this web app means potential clients find a personal trainer in their city quickly.<br />
Sorry no healthshakes, gyms or <abbr title="guys who workout and think that they are cool enough to train">cowboys</abbr> here. <br />
We are serious about certifications.<br />
Personal Trainers can join and add themselves safely with Twitter or Facebook.<br />
When we are happy with their profile we add it to the search.<br />
Their page is free for the life of their certifications. <br />
The bubble wrap is still on with bugs that we are fixing fast.<br />
