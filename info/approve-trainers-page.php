  <h4 class="alt">Checklist to get your profile up</h4>
  <p>We can't wait to start promoting your services.<br />
    Check your profile for these <strong>"MUST HAVES"</strong> by going to your "edit profile" page:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:inherit;">
    <li><strong>Image:</strong> Your best of you only and we need to see your face very clearly</li>
    <li><strong>Base certification:</strong> CPT or others</li>
    <li><strong>Certification Organization:</strong> ACE, NASM, ACSM etc</li>
    <li><strong>Certification Number:</strong> From your degree or issued certificate</li>
    <li><strong>Expiry date:</strong> Most certifications are valid for 2 years only so add expiry date accordingly.<br />
      We realize that for some certifications/degree, no expiry dates apply. Please add 31st December for the current year and renew yearly.<br />
      <small> We may automatically take down profiles if this date expires.</small></li>
  </ul>
