<h3><strong>Facebook advertising  </strong></h3>
  
         <p>At Personal Trainer Wall we do more than host your details on this website. A great deal of effort goes into the promotion of the site so important in 'banging the drum' for all the personal trainers' within. We currently advertise with Facebook and as the PT Wall membership base grows, and contributions through the upgrade subscription pickup, we will gradually increase our daily budget of advertising. </p>
