       <h3>No Health Shakes, Gyms or Muscle Cowboys?</h3>
<p>Started up in 2009, by Web Designer John Brunskill, Personal Trainer Wall is a directory of Independent Personal Trainers from the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK.</p>
<p>
We added some web smarts to make finding a personal trainer easier by detecting the visitors location and serving up Personal Trainers only from that region. With a simple and  search interface, it easy to find a personal trainer in your city.  </p>
<p>Although joining personal trainer wall with facebook or twitter is so easy, we ask the personal trainers who join to fully complete their certifications details. There is a common sense approval process for all new personal trainers and we undertake to ensure that the certifications details are on display at all times. <a rel="facebox" href="/info/disclaimer.php">Very important disclaimer message</a> </p>
