<b>HTPASSWD_REMOTE protect plugin</b>

Password protect directories with this plugin. It generates .htpasswd file 
at remote locations (using aMember remote script). This plugin is different from htpasswd - this plugin
never rebuild .htpasswd file, it only adds/updates/deletes record from it. 
If you don't have existing .htpasswd files, disable this plugin completely.
